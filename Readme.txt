Name: PerformanceTimer
Creator: Matthew Vincent

I have included a class and test project for VB and also a C++ Dll named
'C++ High Performance Timer for VB' which does the same thing as the class.
I built it using ATL Com which means all you need to do to use it in VB
is reference it. You can even have a look at it in the object browser.
